//#1
//Write a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. 
//The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, {name}! where {name} is the name you entered:
//> let rlSync = require('readline-sync');
//>let name = rlSync.question("What is your name?\n");
//>console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

//#2
//Modify the greeter.js program to ask for 
//the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.
//>let rlSync = require('readline-sync');
//>let name = rlSync.question("What is your first name?\n");
//>let lastName = rlSync.question("What is your last name?\n");
//>console.log(`Hello, ${name} ${lastName}!`);

//#3
//Modify the age.js program you wrote in the exercises for the Variables chapter. 
//The updated code should ask the user to enter their age instead of hard-coding the age in the program. 
//Here's an example run:
//>let rlSync = require('readline-sync');
//>let age = rlSync.question("How old are you?\n");
//>age = Number(age)
//>console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
//>console.log (`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10} years old.`);
//>console.log (`In 20 years, you will be ${age + 20} years old.`);
//>console.log (`In 30 years, you will be ${age + 30} years old.`);
//>console.log (`In 40 years, you will be ${age + 40} years old.`);
